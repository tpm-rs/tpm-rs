# Contribution Guidelines

## Guidelines for reporting bugs

Non-security-critical bugs can be filed by opening an Issue in GitHub.

Security sensitive bugs should be reported to
[security-tpm-rs@trustedcomputinggroup.org].
Please refer to the [Security Policy] for more info.

## Guideline for submitting changes

This Repo welcomes contributions, suggestions, and feedback. All
contributions, suggestions, and feedback you submitted are accepted under the
[Repo's license]. You represent that if you do not own
copyright in the code that you have the authority to submit it under the
[Repo's license]. Other than security sensitive bug reports, any
feedback, suggestions, or contributions are NOT confidential, regardless of markings
otherwise.

This Repo implements official public [TPM Library Specification] releases and
errata from the [Trusted Computing Group] ("TCG") along with related supplementary
tools and libraries.

Suggestions to revise TCG publications (e.g. the addition of new commands or
language in the TCG TPM Library specification) must first be approved by TCG
voting members and published in a TCG Specification.  Relevant suggestions
should be directed towards the TPM working group within the TCG via
[admin@trustedcomputinggroup.org].

Other changes consistent with public TPM Specifications particularly to support
new platforms, scenarios, build environments, crypto-libraries, or bug-fixes
will be considered if they are expected to be widely useful.

Contributors that wish to be involved in the future evolution of the TPM and related
specifications should consider joining the Trusted Computing Group.  Information
about membership and liaison programs is available at [TCG Membership].
